# Introduction

I am creating a platform that is: 

1. Free
2.  A place to write articles on various topics. 
3.  Enable readers of the articles to highlight any text and comment on it. 
4.  Enable readers to change or rewrite the article by clicking the Edit button. 
5.  Add Prev and Next links to string a group of articles into a larger theme or a book. 
6.  See previous versions of a specific article to see the evolution of that article. 

My interests include technology: software in particular, business and social impact of technology, 
politics, evolution of democracy in India. 

You can reach me at: fulcrum@hotmail.com

Every article I write will most likely be edited. The idea here is to not wait to be perfect, but provide value for the reader 
and improve the value for successive readers. So leave your suggestions by providing comments or clicking the Edit button and 
writing your version of my article. Yes, you can edit any article, even one that was not originated by you. Your version of the article 
will be added to the cluster around that article. Feel free to improve my grammer, provide corrections to the content or do a wholesale rewrite 
of my article. I am working on improving my ability to organize my thoughts in writing both technical as well as non-technical material. 
So all suggestions are welcome.
