# Exercise
This article is written from the perspective of a person with a sedentary lifestyle who finds excuses for not doing regular exercise. 
I have done a variety of physical activity in the past such as tennis, racquet ball, roller blading, and swimming. However I find myself not doing 
these on a regular basis. 

There are three types of Exercise: Aerobic, Stretching, and Strength.

Sports provide natural exercise in a fun and sometimes competitive setting. If you are a serious athlete you will need to find out what proportion and quantity 
of the three types of exercises you will need to do to supplement your athletic activity. My writing is from the perspective of a person that may work 5 days a 
week and may sit in a chair from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM. This lifestyle is completely unnatural for the human body. Our bodies were not evolved to lead a sedentary 
existence. So my proposed exercise regimen is to overcome this problem. 

I have met a lot of people that talk about doing more exercise. But never get to it. I seem to get into it and then get out of it for stretches of time. So the goal this time 
is to design a regiment that will be sustainable based on what I know about me.

- Stage 1
    - Walk every day for an hour. (This is easy as I like walking)
    - 20 push-ups, 50 squats everyday within a few minutes after I wake up. 
    - 20 minutes of stretches ideally in the middle of the day while taking breaks from work. 


- Stage 2
   -  Strength Training(Twice a week) 20 push-ups, 50 squats, add weights and pullups. 
   -  Stretching(Twice a week): 1 hour of Yoga poses. Yoga is more than poses. But I will keep it simple for now. I will add a *link here for more details later*. 
   -  Aerobic(Twice a week): Run 30 mins and brisk walk 30 mins.  Initially run 10 mins and brisk walk 50 mins, then 20/40 and finally 30/30.
