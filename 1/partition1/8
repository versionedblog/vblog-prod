# Exploring Tense in English
Why are tenses so complicated in English? 

There are 5 dimensions to tenses in the English language. The verb can change for each combination of these dimensions. 

Dimension1: 
  - Related to Subject
  - Values: 
    - First Person
    - Second Person
    - Third Person
Dimension2:
  - Related to Subject
  - Values: 
    - Singular
    - Plural
Dimension3: 
  - Related to Tense
  - Values: 
    - Past
    - Present
    - Future
Dimension4:
  - Related to Tense
  - Values: 
    - Not Something happening at the time in question(Not Progressive)
    - Something happening at the time in question(Progressive)
Dimension5:
  - Related to Tense
  - Values: 
    - Non-Perfect
    - Perfect

Every sentence must use one value from each of the 5 dimensions. 
Since there are 5 dimensions and there are 3,2,3,2,2 values in those dimensions the total number of combinations is: 3 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 = 72

This is the reason why tense is so complicated in English.
