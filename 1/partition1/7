# Eating(Food and Nutrition)
A large amount of reading material exists on food and nutrition. Virtually all of us get pleasure from eating. There are a few people that eat to live while many live to eat.
I will add links here to articles and videos about food and nutrition that I find either useful or interesting. My focus is on finding a diet that is suitable for a largely sedentary 
lifestyle. The amount of exercise I do varies often best on the times of the year, social calendar and work load. The diet must vary based on physical and mental activity. 
I also have a belief that there must be something close to an ideal diet for every person. I have a method of evaluating diet that may not work for everyone. One question 
is: *How does the food feel in my tummy after I eat it ?  Does it seem to sit well? Do I get discomfort?* I can try different foods all of which taste very good to me and evaluate 
how they feel in my tummy. I try to stick with foods that make me feel at ease right after the meal, and hour after the meal and two hours after the meal. For example I love 
milk products. But whenever I consume milk products I get a bad taste in my mouth after 2 hours. I don't know if I am intolerant to a particular component of milk. Many people 
are lactose intolerant or have some allergy related to milk. My approach is that there are so many good sources of tasty nutrition. *So why not just skip the milk?* Notice I am 
not taking a position on whether milk or any other food is good or bad for you. It comes back to the idea that there is an ideal diet for every person. In addition the ideal diet 
may vary with changes in age and lifestyle.
