# Excellence:
Excellence is about being good. Its not aboiut being good once, but being good every day. It is also about the process of being good. 
It about starting a process and doing it enough number of times till your mind and muscle both remember it and internalize it. Riding a bicycle 
is an activity that most of us commit to muscle memory in very few sessions. As I reapeat any activity I become very sensitive how small 
changes in my actions affect the outcome. Intelligence is about the ability to make smaller and smaller distinctions about the material at hand. 
You can actually become smarter by doing an activity many times. When repeating an activity and observing the result and what you did just 
prior to a certain outcome your mind/body combination internalizes the experience. Someone threw out an idea that it takes 10000 hours of 
doing an activity(driving a car, flying an airplane, programming, book-keeping etc.) to get really good at it. I am not going to focus on that number. 
But it is true that the tennis shot or golf swing does get better with every game or practice session. This comes with a caveat. The activity must speak 
to me and reveal itself to me as I repeat it. If I cannot be involved at that level then the progress is very slow. 

Excellence is key. The modern world allows us the luxury of specializing. Specializing allows  us to live simpler lives. If you can find an area of
specialization in which you can excell and if the product of that activity is in great demand then you can have a fulfilling experience. Being 
able to get the job done provides for a middle-class life. Being able to excell opens up opportunities for leadership and higher rewards. 
In this case I am not referring only to monetary rewards. The reward could also be in terms of recognition from your peers and wider audiences. 

What do you excel at or what can you excel at? Can you provide a different perspective on excellence.
