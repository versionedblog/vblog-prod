# Introduction

All the articles are written with the assumption that the reader is familiar with Java 1.7 and is learning scala usign their knowlede of java as a starting point. 
I find that learning happens often by extension. If you already know somethign then attaching new information to existing information may make it easier to learn. 

I have not used Java 1.8 a whole lot. I may occasionally explore some Java examples in Java1.8.
